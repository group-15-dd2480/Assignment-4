# What is Karate?

Karate is an open-source test automation framework that unifies API testing, mocking, performance testing, and UI automation into a single, cohesive tool.
Its primary goal is to simplify the test automation process by providing a language-neutral syntax that is accessible to both technical and non-technical users.

## Purpose of Karate

Karate addresses the challenges of integrating multiple testing tools by offering a unified platform that supports various testing needs:

- **API Testing**: Facilitates testing of RESTful and SOAP services with straightforward syntax.
- **Mocking**: Allows simulation of APIs to test interactions without relying on actual services.
- **Performance Testing**: Enables performance assessments of APIs to ensure they meet required standards.
- **UI Automation**: Supports automation of web UI testing, providing a comprehensive testing solution.

## Architecture of Karate

- **karate-core**: The foundational module that provides core functionalities, including the scripting engine and DSL for writing tests.
- **karate-apache**: Handles HTTP client operations using Apache's HTTP client libraries, facilitating communication with APIs during testing.
- **karate-jersey**: An alternative HTTP client implementation based on the Jersey framework, offering flexibility in client selection.
- **karate-netty**: Implements the mock server using the Netty framework, allowing users to simulate API endpoints for testing purposes.
- **karate-junit5**: Provides integration with JUnit 5, enabling users to execute Karate tests within the JUnit framework.
- **karate-gatling**: Integrates with the Gatling tool to support performance testing, allowing users to assess the performance of their APIs.
- **karate-robot**: Facilitates UI automation by simulating user interactions with graphical interfaces, extending Karate's capabilities to UI testing.
