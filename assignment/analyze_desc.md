# Karate README analysis

## Strengths
- The documentation is extensive and well-structured with documented links to various helpful documentations. 
- The table of contents is well integrated which makes it easy to navigate to the sections you desire. 
- The documentation does a good job at providing the information needed for different use cases. 
- The feature list is well implemented with clear instructions of Karate's capabilites including mocks, API, testing, performance testing and UI automation.
- Several videos, examples and the "Hello World" section with example that makes it easier, especially for new users, to learn how to get it running. 
- Clear headlines for sections giving users insight what the sections are about.

## Improvements
- A troubleshooting section could be added in order to make it easier to troubleshoot problems.
- Possibly reducing the amount of links and replacing them with summaries of the content needed from the links could make the documentation easier to read and understand.
- Could use more code examples to explain instead of long text explanations.
- Add a section on how to get started if you want to contribute to the project.

## Is it Sufficient?
It is mostly sufficient. The ones who could find it insufficient are users inexperienced in the field. The quick start guide and examples videos helps but as Karate got lots of use cases and the documentation is very extensive and possibly difficult to fully grasp, new users could struggle with fully understanding Karate and how to use it. 
All in all, we found the documentation sufficient however.
