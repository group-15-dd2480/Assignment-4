By our assessment we have once again reached stage 5: Working well from our previous assignment where we were at stage 3: In Use. We were in stage 5 previously, for the first assignment, at it was clear for everybody what was happening and what needed to be done. As the complexity of the assignments increased, we regressed, first to stage 4: In place, for the second assignment, and as mentioned previously, stage 3 for the third assignment. As we have gotten more diligent with planning the assignments, we have had fewer issues and higher productivity. For example, we spend much more time selecting a repository for this assignment than for the last assignment, this resulted in higher productivity as the number of issues encountered was decreased.

As we feel we are currently working well, there is no real obstacles for us to reach the next stage which is stage 6: Retired. Perhaps one obstacle could be that we are not finished with the assignment at the point of writing this.
