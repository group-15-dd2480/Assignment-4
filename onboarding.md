# Onboarding Experience

Due to our negative experiences with the previous repository chosen, we decided to switch repository for this assignment. After careful deliberation, we decided on the project Karate. 

## Karate

The onboarding for Karate (in our eyes) was pretty simple. It used Maven, which we had used for the previous assignments, so building the entire project was as easy as running a simple Maven command. The build times where a bit longer than for our previous projects, which was a bit tedious, but in the end it went smoothly and all tests passed.

Although we had never used Karate before, it was simple enough to get a surface-level understanding of what the project was for, which then helped when diving deeper into the project.

Altering the project did not result in any issues, and all tests, along with those added, ran without issues. This was a welcome change from what we experienced in the previous assignment.

## Previous Onboarding (gson)

On the surface, the onboarding for the previous project—which in our case was gson—went smoothly. We had some previous experience with the repository, as we had used it for a previous assignment. It built quick, just took around 30 seconds. Not all tests passed, but we deemed it to be fine since the core-module passed. In hindsight, this was a red flag. This really indicated that there was a lot of dependencies and that small changes or different setups could make the build fail.

When we then started to alter the repo, several issues presented themselves, which we ultimately had to fix by disabling some of the more egregious requirements, and removing some dependencies which caused issues. The entire process was a pain, and ultimately the reason for why we decided to switch projects for this assignment.
