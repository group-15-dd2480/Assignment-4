# Project Plan

- Confirm that status messages exist in the HTTP response.
- Implement the response classes to include the getStatusText() function.
- Ensure it fetches the correct status codes and messages from HTTP responses.
- Update the API to incorporate the changes.
- Implement unit tests to test getStatusText() and ensure it returns the correct message for different HTTP responses. 
- Ensure existing functionality still works as intended.
